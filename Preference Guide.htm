<h1><a name="_Toc70912710">1. Purpose of the game</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'><br>
   Preference is a three player card game from </span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Europe</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>, which is similar to bridge, euchre, and five-hundred. The
rules and scoring vary slightly, according to local custom. Preference is
played with 32 cards: the A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8 and 7s from a standard 4-suit
52-card deck are used. The cards are dealt five at a time to each player face
down, with two cards dealt face down to form the widow. The widow should not be
the last two cards dealt, instead should be two cards after first round of five
cards each. Deal rotates clockwise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of Preference is to win more final scores
than opponents. The game is usually played to 180-450 summed bullet points of
all players and is made up of a number of hands. Each hand consists of three
stages - the bidding, the whist and the play. After hand is over new bullet,
mountain and whist points are added to a pool and new final scores are
calculated.</span></p>

<h2><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></h2>

<h1><a name="_Toc70912711">2. Idea of the Game</a></h1>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>In each hand, one player
(the declarer) chooses the contract and tries to make at least six of the ten
possible tricks. The other two (the defenders) try to prevent the declarer from
winning, but also have an objective to make a total of at least four tricks. A
defender who thinks he cannot contribute his share is allowed to drop out,
leaving the other defender with a quota of only two tricks. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>At the beginning of each
hand there is an auction to decide who will be declarer. As the contract is
always 6 tricks, the different bids relate to the different trump</span> <span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>suits, and whether the declarer
wants to make use of the two undealt cards. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The ranking of the suits
themselves, from low to high is: <a name=value></a></span></p>

<h1>&nbsp;<a name="_Toc70912712">3. The bidding</a></h1>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'><br>
<br>
The player on the Dealer's right has first opportunity to bid or pass, and the
turn to bid passes counterclockwise. If all pass, a <b><i>Refa</i></b> is given
to each player, causing the score next time they are declarer to be doubled;
the deck then passes to the next player who becomes dealer. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The possible bids are the
numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, and <strong><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>game</span></strong>.
Two through five represent the suits, six represents <strong><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>Bettel</span></strong>, and seven represents <strong><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>Sans </span></strong><strong><span style='font-family:
Tahoma;font-weight:normal'>(</span></strong></span><em>sans atout</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>)</span></em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>. When bidding numbers, only the minimum legal bid can be
made at any time (the bids must increase by one). The bid <em><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>Game</span></em> means that the player wishes to be
declarer without using the talon cards. This bid is automatically higher than a
numerical bid. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The player who has bid the
highest number does not necessarily have to play the contract corresponding to
that number - he may choose a higher contract. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Thus the first player to
bid can only pass or say &quot;two&quot;, or &quot;game&quot;. Saying
&quot;two&quot; expresses the intention to exchange with the talon and then
take 6 or more tricks in his choice of trumps. Saying &quot;game&quot;
expresses the intention to choose trumps and take 6 or more tricks without
exchanging cards. Once a player has bid &quot;game&quot;, no more numerical
bids can be made. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Once a player has bid
&quot;two&quot;, a subsequent player has the option of bidding
&quot;three&quot; or &quot;game&quot; or passing. Over a bid of
&quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot; or &quot;game&quot; can be bid, and so on.
Numerical jump bids are not allowed. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>No player who has passed
may reenter the bidding and a player who has made a number bid cannot later
increase his bid to &quot;game&quot;. Therefore if you want to bid a game at
all you must do it at your first opportunity to speak. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Once &quot;game&quot; has
been bid only another bid of &quot;game&quot; can outbid it. If two players bid
&quot;game&quot;, they must each reveal their proposed contracts in turn and
the higher contract wins. (If the first player has a higher bid, the second
player may remain silent and not reveal his bid). In the unlikely event that
two players claim the same suit then the first player (counting counterclockwise
starting from the player on the dealer's right) has precedence.
&quot;Game&quot; bids of six or seven are announced as &quot;Bettel&quot; or
&quot;Sans&quot;. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>When the bidding reaches a
player who bid a number on the first round and has been outbid by a higher
number, the first bidder can either pass or say &quot;same&quot; or &quot;me
too&quot;. &quot;Same&quot; is equivalent to bidding the same number as the
second bidder, which is sufficient to allow the first bidder to be declarer. If
the second bidder wants to continue, he must go on to the next number, for
which the first bidder may again say &quot;same&quot;, and so on. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Some examples of legal
bidding sequences (<strong><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>A</span></strong>
is the first bidder (to dealer's left), <strong><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>B</span></strong>
is the second bidder, and <strong><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>C</span></strong>
is the dealer): </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>The declarer undertakes to take six tricks. There are no
trumps, and he never leads to the first trick. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>All of the
contracts can also be played as games, that is, without exchanging the talon.
In this case the value for them in the scoring is increased by one. If a player

&quot;Sans&quot;, rather than the numbers. </span></p>

<h1><a name=defenders> </a><a name="_Toc70912715">6. The Defenders' Decisions</a></h1>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Now each of the defenders
must decide whether to play. Playing is a commitment to win at least two
tricks, and there is a penalty for failing to do so. A defender who does not
think he can make two tricks can drop out. This means that he does not wish to
take part in the play, and he cannot be penalised for failing to take his quota
of tricks, but on the other hand dropping out makes it easier for declarer to
win. If both defenders decide to play, they play as a team, needing four tricks
in combination. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>First the defender on the
declarer's left announces whether he will play, followed by the other defender.
If neither wishes to play then declarer has (by default) won 10 tricks. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If only one defender
wishes to play, he may invite his partner to defend with him. This invitation
cannot be refused, but the guest is not penalized if he fails to make two (or
any) tricks - instead the host defender takes on the responsibility for the
defending team making at least four tricks. A defender who does not wish to
play and is not invited to do so lays his cards face down and takes no further
part in the hand. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If one defender plays and
wins two or more tricks, he is safe. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If both defenders play
voluntarily and they win four or more tricks, they are both safe. If they win
three tricks, the defender with two or three tricks is safe, and the defender
with one or none pays a penalty. If they win two tricks, only a defender with
both tricks is safe and the other pays the penalty. If they win one trick each,
or only one or zero tricks in total, both defenders pay the penalty. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If one defender invited
the other, and they win four or more tricks, the host is safe. If they win
three or fewer tricks the host pays a penalty. The invited player is always
safe. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The defenders' scoring is
limited to a total of five tricks only. When the defenders have taken five
tricks play ends, the declarer has failed to make the contract, and the
defenders score for the tricks they have taken. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1><a name=kontra> </a><a name="_Toc70912716">6. Kontra</a> </h1>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Once the declarer selects
the contract, with or without exchanging the talon, and the defenders have
determined who will defend, one of the defenders may say &quot;Kontra&quot;,
which is an undertaking that the defenders will win at least 5 tricks, thus
defeating the contract. The defender to declarer's left has the first option to
Kontra, and if he does not, then the other defender may Kontra. Saying Kontra
doubles all the scores for the hand and automatically &quot;invites&quot; the
other defender (only the host scores). If the defenders take 4 or fewer tricks,
the host pays a penalty. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Once a Kontra is declared,
if the declarer is confident of winning at least six tricks he may say &quot;Rekontra&quot;,
which doubles the score again. The defender who said Kontra is still
responsible for the defence making at least 5 tricks. This defender may then
say &quot;Rekontra&quot;, doubling again. If the contract is a plain
&quot;two&quot; (without &quot;game&quot; and without refa), one of the
defenders must say Kontra if they want the hand to be played. If neither is
willing to do so, there is no play and the declarer wins ten tricks by default.
</span></p>

<h1><a name=play> </a><a name="_Toc70912717">7. The Play</a></h1>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If both defenders have
conceded there is of course no play - the declarer just wins. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If one or both defenders
play, the player to the dealer's right normally leads to the first trick. If
the player to dealer's left is a defender who has dropped out and not been
invited to play, the next player in rotation leads. If the contract is a <strong><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>Sans</span></strong> the declarer is not allowed to
lead to the first trick, so if it would have been his lead, the lead passes to
the next player in rotation. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>It is necessary: </span></p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>to
     follow suit if able </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>when
     holding no card of the led suit, to play a trump if possible </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>A player
who holds no card of the led suit and no trumps may play any card. It is not
necessary to play a card beating those already in the trick. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The winner of a trick is
determined as follows: </span></p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If any
     trumps were played, the highest trump card. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If a
     trump card was not played, the highest card in the suit that was led. </span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The winner
of a trick leads to the next. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Note that although in some
situations, the scoring appears to create a slight conflict of interest between
the defenders, their priority is to play as a team to take five tricks and
defeat the declarer. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1><a name=scoring> </a><a name="_Toc70912718">8. Scoring</a></h1>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Each player</span></strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'> keeps his own score on paper in
three columns, as shown in the illustration bellow. The center column is the
player's &quot;declarer&quot; or main score, the left column is his defender
column when his left hand opponent is declarer, and the right column is his
defender column when his right hand opponent is declarer. These left and right
columns are called bullet points or <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>bula</span></em>
(pronounced &quot;booh-la&quot;). The declarer column starts as a negative
number, and in the final reckoning points in the declarer column are worth ten
times as much as points in the other two columns. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The players agree
beforehand which number to begin playing from and enter it into their declarer
column. Typical starting levels are 60, 80, or more. Although this represents a
negative number, it is not written with a minus sign. Therefore amounts won are
subtracted from this number (to make it less negative) and amounts lost are
added. When a player has won enough so that the score in his declarer column
crosses zero this is indicated by putting a <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>hat</span></em>
<img width=23 height=11 src="Preference%20Guide_files/image001.gif">in the
column. This player is then <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>under the hat</span></em>:
his score is positive, so winnings are added and losings are subtracted. It may
happen that the declarer then loses so that his score becomes negative again;
at this point he draws an inverted hat <img width=23 height=11
src="Preference%20Guide_files/image002.gif">in his declarer column, and ceases
to be <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>under the hat</span></em>. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The basic score for a
non-game contract is double the value of the contract, i.e. double the number
of the bid. A &quot;game&quot; contract has one added to the value of the
contract before it is doubled. So for example an ordinary contract of clubs scores
10 <tt><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>(2x5)</span></tt> but game in clubs
scores 12 <tt><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>(2x(5+1))</span></tt>. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The declarer scores in the
declarer column only. If he has won six or more tricks (zero tricks for Bettel),
he wins the basic score (double the value of the contract). If he failed to
make the contract he loses the same basic score (this is the penalty). </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Each defender scores for
any tricks he won in the appropriate defender column. Each trick won is worth
the basic score (double the value of the contract). The defenders do not score
more than five tricks total, as the declarer has failed to make the contract at
that point. A defender who was invited does not score; the inviting defender
scores all tricks and pays any penalty. The defender columns carry a running
total through the game; scores are only added there - never subtracted. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If a defender has failed
to make his quota of tricks, he subtracts the basic score (double the value of
the contract) from his declarer column (this is the penalty). He still scores
any tricks won in the defender column in the normal way. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If the defenders succeeded
in making the declarer win a trick during a non-game &quot;Bettel&quot;, each
scores 60 in the corresponding defender column, and the declarer is penalized
12 (double the value of the contract). In a game Bettel, the declarer is penalised
14 and each defender scores 70 in the appropriate column. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>In the event of a <i>kontra</i>,
all the scores mentioned above are doubled, in the event of <i>rekontra</i>
they are quadrupled, and so on. A <i>refa</i> also has the effect of doubling
the scores; if there is a <i>kontra</i> of a contract where the declarer also
has a <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>refa</span></em>, both doubles take
effect simultaneously, for a net factor of four, a simulatneous <em><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>rekontra</span></em> and <em><span style='font-family:
Tahoma'>refa</span></em> would multiply all scores by 8, and so on. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1><a name=refa> </a><a name="_Toc70912719">9. Refa</a></h1>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If all players pass during
the bidding, a doubling (<em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>Refa</span></em>)
of the scoring for each player's next contract occurs. This is indicated by a
horizontal line (like this: <img width=23 height=11
src="Preference%20Guide_files/image003.gif">)in the declarer column of each
player. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Whenever a declarer has a <em><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>Refa</span></em> in his declarer column, all scoring
counts double for that hand. Once the scoring has taken place, that player's <em><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>Refa</span></em> is deleted by a short diagonal line
(like this <img width=23 height=11 src="Preference%20Guide_files/image004.gif">),
and the value of the contract is written alongside. If there were no further <em><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>Refas</span></em> in his column, the next time he is
declarer the scoring is normal. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If a player is above zero
(under the hat) in the declarer column, a <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>refa</span></em>
is not declared when all players pass - the deal simply passes to the next
player without further effect. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>There is a maximum number
of <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>refas</span></em> in a game, which
depends on the starting score. Starting from 60, a maximum of two <em><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>refas</span></em> are allowed. Starting from 40,
just one <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>refa</span></em> is allowed.
After the maximum number of <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>refas</span></em>
have been declared, if all players pass, there is no effect. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>All refas are subject to
an internal agreement beetwen the players.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1><a name=ending> </a><a name="_Toc70912720">10. Ending the Game</a></h1>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The game ends when the sum
of all declarer columns is zero. Note that the declarer column scoring is
allowed to go through zero, from negative to positive, and on occasion back
again from positive to negative. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If the value of a
successful contract should exceed the amount needed to achieve a zero sum of
the declarer columns, the value of that contract is reduced so as to make the
sum exactly zero, thus ending the game. This same reduction applies to the
defenders' trick score as well as the declarer's score for the contract. (If
however the declarer were to play that same contract and fail, or if a defender
were to fail and be penalized, this would not take the sum of declarer scores
to zero, so the contract would be scored in full and the game would continue.) </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The final calculation of

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Here is an example of how
the scoresheets might look at the end of a game. The players, in counterclockwise
rotation, are A, B and C. Each player has his <em><span style='font-family:

against his right-hand opponent on the right. The letters in red refer to the
notes below:<br>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(a) This is the starting score - in this game the players
agreed to start from 30. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(b) C played diamonds and won 6 tricks, scoring 6 (2x3) in
his declarer column, improving his score to minus 24. A and B both played and
won 2 tricks each, so they each score 12 against A. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(c) B played in clubs and won; C played and took 3 tricks;
A decided not to play. So B gains 10 and C scores 30 against B. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(d) Everyone passed, so a <em><span style='font-family:
Tahoma'>refa</span></em> was declared. A horizontal line is drawn in each
declarer's column. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(e) A played in acorns taking 7 tricks. B dropped out and C
took 3 tricks. The scores are doubled, as this is A's <em><span

against A. A's <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>refa</span></em> is
cancelled and 20 written beside it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(f) C played &quot;game&quot; in hearts. A defended, B
wanted to drop out but A invited him to play. A and B won 4 tricks. This is C's
<em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>refa</span></em>, so again the scores are
double. C's <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>refa</span></em> is cancelled
and 20 is written by it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(g) A plays in leaves. B says Kontra, but B and C only win
3 tricks. The value of the game is 4, but because of the Kontra, A scores 8.
Also B loses 8 in his declarer column because the defence failed to win their
quota of 4 tricks, but scores 24 against A in his <em><span style='font-family:
Tahoma'>bula</span></em> for the 3 tricks. There is no further double for <em><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>refa</span></em> because A's <em><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>refa</span></em> was already used (e). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(h) B plays a Bettel and loses. This is B's <em><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>refa</span></em> so he loses double (24). A and C
each score 120 against B (equivalent of 5 tricks). B's <em><span
style='font-family:Tahoma'>refa</span></em> is cancelled and 24 is written
beside it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(i) C plays a Bettel and succeeds in losing every trick.
The 12 he wins makes his score positive - he is now <em><span style='font-family:
Tahoma'>under the hat</span></em>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(j) C plays clubs. A and B both defend: A takes 4 tricks
and B takes 1. C's loss of 10 points makes his score negative again - he is no
longer <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>under the hat</span></em>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(k) A plays in hearts. C says Kontra, but A says Rekontra
and wins 6 tricks. A scores 32 (4x8) and C scores 128 against A for the 4
tricks taken by the defence. A is now <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>under
the hat</span></em>. As the defence has failed to take 5 tricks, C is penalised
32 in his declarer column. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(l) C plays game <em><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>sans</span></em>,
scoring 16. B defends and takes two tricks. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(m) B plays in clubs. C wants to drop out but A invites C
to play and the defenders win 4 tricks. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(n) B plays &quot;game&quot; in acorns. Neither A nor C
wishes to defend, so there is no play and B scores 12. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Tahoma'>(p) B plays clubs. A and C both defend, A winning 1 trick
and C 3 tricks. As they won their quota of 4 tricks between them neither
defender incurs a penalty. B has won a contract whose value would normally be
10, but as this would make the sum of declarer columns positive, its value is
reduced to 6 which makes them add up to zero. The tricks won by A and C are
therefore also only worth 6 each. </span></p>
